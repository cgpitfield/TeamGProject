2. # **Project Description/Business Case** {#project-description/business-case}

   1. **Background**

      Tiger Sushi is a Korean-owned all-you-can-eat sushi and hibachi restaurant located in the heart of Downtown Athens. Since opening in November of last year, the restaurant has gained local popularity but lacks a formal digital presence beyond its Instagram page.

      

   2. **Problem**

      While Tiger Sushi has strong word-of-mouth appeal, it currently has no official website to provide customers with essential information such as menu options, hours of operation, pricing, and special events. This limits the restaurant’s ability to engage with new customers, answer common questions, and update followers in real time.

      

   3. **Project Goal**

      The goal of this project is to design and deliver a detailed, professional wireframe for a future Tiger Sushi website. This wireframe will communicate critical restaurant information, align with the brand’s identity, and provide an intuitive user experience that enhances customer engagement.

      

   4. **Proposed Solution**

      Our team will create a comprehensive website wireframe that includes pages for the menu, hours, FAQs, special events, and photo galleries of the restaurant and its offerings. The design will reflect Tiger Sushi’s brand and ensure ease of use for visitors. This wireframe will serve as a foundation for future website development and provide the restaurant with a clear path toward establishing a strong online presence. 

3. # **Project Scope – Scope Statement**  {#project-scope-–-scope-statement}

4. # **Measurable Organizational Impact** {#measurable-organizational-impact}

   1. Creating a wireframe for Tiger Sushi’s website that focuses on key information such as the menu, hours, specials, FAQs, and will provide several benefits. For the tangible benefits, the wireframe serves as a strategic planning tool to help Tiger Sushi visualize how the content of the website can be organized and accessed. This will reduce developmental time of the website, which will help implementation be faster and more cost-effective in the future. The expected value is high for creating the wireframe, as it not only saves time and money, but it also lays out the groundwork for improving customer experience and engagement through having a comprehensive and information wireframe. For intangible benefits, the wireframe can support organization and decision making for stakeholders on what their potential website could look like. This enhances cross-functional communication between different stakeholders which improves collaboration to create a better user experience and create a clearer brand message. The value of this stems from having a structured planning process to implement the wireframe. From a cost perspective, the wireframe requires minimal financial outlay. For internal labor, this involves creating the design and content of the wireframe which approximately involves 5-10 hours of creating at an average of $25/hr for a total of $125 to $250. As this project does not require specific software or tools for website building, there are no external consultants. Thus, creating the wireframe creates a valuable impact as it will support future phases of implementation and provides a strong foundation.

5. # **Project Stakeholders**  {#project-stakeholders}

1. For this project we have 3 main stakeholders. Our first stakeholder is Louis Lee who owns Tiger sushi and is the one who determines the funds for the project as well as the scheduling. Our second stakeholder is Johnathon Miller who is the manager at Tiger Sushi and is the one we are in communication with on design and technical requirements for the website along with being the main person we are in communication with to make sure our project is aligned with the vision that Tiger Sushi hopes for their website. Our third stakeholder is our team who is working on the project and setting goals along with helping with the handoff for the creation of the website.

   

2. Our communication with our client was not great as the owner Louis Lee left to go to Korea in the beginning of our project. We talked to him mainly about costs and finances and it seemed as if he did not want to put money into a website right now and was fine with our group creating a wireframe for them to use in the future. We had better communication with Johnathon Miller the manager at Tiger Sushi as Brandon was able to talk to him in person frequently. We gathered information from him about features and pictures for the project as well as whether or not they would actually implement the website. Jonathan explained what features would be best for the website. However, he did not send pictures as he did not have them and when he would ask Louis for the pictures Louis would not respond. This led us to working around that and gathering pictures from instagram as well as from Brandon when he would work.

   <img width="627" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-26 at 1 19 54 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc6f5951-bc3b-4dd6-bbb7-73b581359388" />
   

6. # **Project Administration (Risk, Issue, and change logs)** {#project-administration-(risk,-issue,-and-change-logs)}

1. For this project, we are operating under a few assumptions. First, Tiger Sushi requires only a wireframe and not a full website. Second, that the timeline will be as scheduled, and lastly, that the budget will remain the same throughout the project. Along with these assumptions, four main risks have been identified: scope creep, misalignment with client expectations, lack of access to necessary materials and information, and the company going out of business.   

<img width="561" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-26 at 1 20 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5908fd8a-4169-41c4-a5b2-37b3d6f4f707" />

     
2. For change management, we have implemented a plan to address any changes that may be requested. These changes could be from the sponsor or any of any team member. The plan first starts off with a discussion between the team members, then it will be shown to the sponsor for approval and feedback. After the change has been approved, then it will be recorded in the change log to document what the change is, who has it been required by, and the time and cost impact. This ensures all changes are tracked in a transparent and controlled manner.  

<img width="636" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-26 at 1 20 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e5d86e-d3a9-4fbb-b3ec-1bf4f526baf9" />


3. For issue management, our team makes sure to handle any promise that arises throughout the course of our project. We first log the issue and ensure that all team members are aware of the situation. Details such as the description of the issue, date it is reported, resolution status, etc. are all collected. The issue will be monitored and if it continues to impact communication or deadlines, the team will escalate the concern and work towards a solution to ensure the project remains on track.   
   
<img width="633" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-26 at 1 20 21 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74af6e47-e097-4987-bb2b-5f415bf8c1ae" />

4. **Quality Issues and how you will manage quality**  
   1. Quality requirements for your major deliverables  
      1. The wireframe for Tiger Sushi must be clear, visually appealing, and user-friendly.  
      2. It should reflect the restaurant’s branding, atmosphere, and unique offerings.   
      3. All pages, such as the Home, Menu, About, Contact, and possibly a Gallery or Order Online section, should be intuitive to navigate.   
      4. Content placeholders should be well-structured to allow easy replacement with real information when the site is eventually built.  
           
5. **Triple Constraint Model**  
   1. Using the triple constraint model (scope, time, and cost), we define high quality as staying within scope (a full wireframe, not a live website), delivering on time, and using resources efficiently.  
      For this project, “high quality” will be determined by:  
* Meeting client expectations and incorporating their feedback  
* Ensuring all required pages are present and logically laid out  
* Design that supports easy future development  
* Visual appeal that matches Tiger Sushi’s vibe  
  Quality will be reviewed internally by the team and externally through feedback from the Tiger Sushi manager before finalizing.

7. # **Project Schedule Summary** {#project-schedule-summary}

   1. The project to deliver professional wireframes for Tiger Sushi begins on March 10th and will conclude on May 1st, with the goal of presenting and handing over a polished wireframe that communicates the menu, specials, key information, FAQs and more to customers. For our first phase of project conception and initiation, this runs from March 10th to March 17th. During this stage, we will conduct initial research on tiger Sushi, formulate interview questions, explore web design ideas and resources, and conduct interviews with key stakeholders. This preliminary groundwork will ensure a clear understanding of the customers needs and requirements. Our second phase of project definition and planning, runs from March 18th to April 2nd. In this phase, we will refine the project plan, set a realistic budget as we acquire information, and develop a communication plan to keep the stakeholders informed. At this stage as well, we will begin anticipating potential challenges and risk management to ensure a smooth process. For our third phase of performance and monitoring, we will be developing and refining the wire frames to include the necessary requirements asked by the stakeholder. This includes a menu, photo gallery, location, and contact information, FAQs, and anything else needed. These deliverables will be evaluated for quality and as a team we will review how close we are to staying within scope to making changes if necessary. For the final stretch of the project, phase four spanning from April 25th to May 1st, will involve making adjustments and final preparations to begin the process of handing over the wire frame and finalizing our presentation materials. Once the project concludes and the wireframe is handed over to Tiger Sushi, it will help the Tiger Sushi enhance its customer engagement and will help provide a foundation for website design in the future.  
        
      

8. # **Resources Required**  {#resources-required}

   1. We used Figma to design the wireframes because it offers a wide range of helpful features for collaborative design. Its real-time editing capabilities made it easy for our team to work together efficiently. Figma also allowed us to quickly create and adjust layouts, which was especially useful during the early stages of design.   
   2. Because we couldn’t get photos from Jonathon, we turned to the Tiger Sushi Instagram for visuals. This helped us incorporate relevant images into the wireframes and better visualize the final website.

9. # **Project Budget Summary**  {#project-budget-summary}

   1. As this is a school-based design project with no actual development, there is no monetary cost. However, we estimate that creating this wireframe requires about 30 collective work hours across the team, with pricing at $25 an hour. If Tiger Sushi were to outsource this to a professional designer, it might cost anywhere between $500 to $1,500 depending on the designer’s experience and the complexity of the wireframe.  
   2. **Time Breakdown Estimate**   
      1) Client consultations & research: 4-5 hours  
         2) Initial draft & design phase: 10-12  hours  
         3) Internal reviews & revisions: 8-9 hours  
         4) Final polish and presentation prep: 4-5 hours  
   3. **Cost Estimate Table**  
      

| Cost Type | Description | Estimated Amount |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Labor Hours | Approximately 30 total team hours ($25 per hour) for interviews, design, revisions, and presentation work | $750 |
| External Web Developer (Optional) | Estimated cost if outsourced to a professional web designer | $500 \- $1500 |
| Software & Tools | Figma, Adobe Lightroom, & Zoom (Free with Student Licensure) | $0 |
| Visual Content Resources | Sourced directly from Tiger Sushi’s internal team photos and Instagram | $0 |
| Travel or In Person Meetings | No additional travel or external meeting costs | $0 |
|  | **Estimated Total Range** | **$750 \- $2,250** |

      

      

10. # **Design documentation and discussion**  {#design-documentation-and-discussion}

    

1. Our design approach for the Tiger Sushi wireframe was centered around having a user-friendly digital experience that provides all information and needs from the sponsor in a clear and engaging way. We decided to structure the wireframe to include the Home, Menu, About, FAQs, and Reservation page which are all accessed through a navigation bar at the top, linked in the Executive Summary portion. The Home page first introduces Tiger Sushi and what they offer. With the logo and a location map on the page too, this helps provide important information that a customer would want to know on the first page. The Menu page outlines the pricing and rules of the all-you-can-eat experience so customers know what to expect, especially if it is their first time. Also listed are all the offerings divided into categories such as appetizers, tiger rolls, classic rolls and more. This page is essential for helping customers set an expectation of the type of food offered. Then, in the About Us page, it tells the story behind Tiger Sushi and its founder, Louis Lee. This page includes imagery and a narrative that communicates the restaurant's mission, culinary style, and high quality. The FAQs page addresses common questions around specials, reservations, or more in an easy to read format. This overall helps the restaurant reduce common inquiries and they can spend more time focusing on service. The reserve page is an interactive page in which customers can input the number of guests, date, and time for their visit all in one efficient spot. This helps manage customer flow and avoids overcrowding, especially during peak hours. Since this is an all-you-can-eat spot, this can improve efficiency for customers and staff. For the wireframe design, we kept with the brand color palette of navy, orange, and lavender to maintain strong branding while keeping a modern layout. We maintained the same typography for consistency and used larger headers and bolding to enhance clarity. Overall, this wireframe for Tiger Sushi fulfills the needs of the sponsor of creating a stronger online presence, creating an easy and efficient user-experience, and to provide important information about the restaurant to all users across all devices. 

11. # **Implementation**  {#implementation}

    

1. **Strategy:**   
* Research other restaurant websites for inspiration  
* Brainstorm ideas of what we want to add to our website  
* Come up with color scheme that fits the restaurant’s color scheme  
* Keep in mind user experience making sure everything is easy to find and not cluttered  
2. **Challenges:**  
* Scope Creep as we hope our client does not want more features added last minute  
* Making sure the wireframe looks authentic and what the client wants  
* Staying within the time constraints of the project and not adding more features that would not be able to be implemented in the given time  
* Keep in mind UX while fitting in all the needed information  
3. **Solutions:**  
* Using appropriate white space to ensure the website looks good and not cluttered  
* Keep in contact with the client and ensure we are actively communicating with them our progress  
* Establish our scope and set what our vision is and what our client’s vision is to make sure we do not experience scope creep  
* Break down the project into small tasks and set deadlines for deliverables to stay on track  
4. **Required Follow-Up**  
* Collect feedback from client on wireframe for any slight tweaks they may want that does not overstep from the scope of the project  
* Prepare a presentation for client stepping them through the wireframe  
* Research web developers and other ways to make handoff to client smoother


  


12. # **Project Handoff** {#project-handoff}

    

    1. Since we are doing a wireframe we thought it was best to do a handoff. For our handoff we will create a presentation for our client stepping them through the wireframe explaining the features Whenthat could be implemented as well as explaining our design with a short explanation of our design decisions such as layout, buttons, and colors chosen for the wireframe. Then we will explain the flow of the website with key interactions as well as functionality. We will then create a document explaining the project goal, target audience, and any known constraints of the wireframe for the people who will be creating the website so they have a better understanding of what we were hoping to accomplish with our wireframe. After we present the wireframe we will create a summary of the feedback we have received so that we could pass that information as well to the web developers for any changes that may be needed. In doing all of these steps we hope to be able to give our client the website they were hoping of and making sure the next team that gets our wireframe understands it and is easily able to implement it into a real website.

13. # **Individual Lessons Learned** {#individual-lessons-learned}

**RYAN:** Throughout this semester-long project, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to come together with a group of individuals to deliver value for an Athens business while learning many lessons along the way. It is funny to think about our first day together as a group to the point where we are at now, as we went from strangers to good friends in a matter of months. I would say the thing that I am the most proud of is the way our team communicates, as everyone would be on the same page throughout the project and everyone wanted to be involved. 

When it comes to project management, I believe the key to our success was that everyone on our team knew their role and performed excellently in it. For the selection of our project, I normally try to be the one that picks and communicates with the sponsor, but I decided not to pursue that avenue during this project and I wanted to let someone else have the chance to be the direct contact with our sponsor. It let me have the chance to not take control of everyone and truly let me be part of the team, versus trying to be the team. I am thankful to myself looking back at this decision as it is something I have been trying to work on throughout college. 

One thing I found frustrating throughout the project was the lack of enthusiasm and cooperation with our project sponsor, as it went from the owner of the company to the manager at the restaurant. Once the owner left and went back to Korea, we had limited communication with the manager and he expressed to our group how they will likely not choose to implement a website at this point in time, which was a hard pill to swallow. Fortunately, these types of things happen all the time in the business world, so I am lucky to go through this experience during a class project before I enter the real-world workforce. 

While we will all be going our separate ways after this class ends, it is nice to have this group experience before we all go into our summer internships and have projects with people we do not currently know. I know that I will definitely be taking lessons from this class and this project with me into my summer internship, which can better set me up for success in the long run. Finally, I am thankful to have this opportunity to work with a group of such amazing people and I look forward to seeing where everyone ends up in the future\! 

**CAROLINE:** In reflecting upon our final project, I believe Team G was very successful, specifically with our collaboration, alignment, and resilience. Although we come from different backgrounds and did not know each other before the project, we created a shared vision and worked together to achieve it. I am proud of our group for overcoming obstacles and delivering polished wireframes to our client.

I really enjoyed getting to employ my creative skills to design the wireframes. Because I study MIS and film, I have a good outlet for both my technical side and creative side, but I rarely get to utilize both skill sets in a classroom setting. I have creative endeavors that I do in my free time, so it was interesting to have something so scheduled. I really liked having the work breakdown structure to keep me on schedule, and I think I could implement something similar on a smaller scale to keep track of my personal projects.

My biggest personal challenge was dealing with frustrations with our client. I have a hard time giving up control, so it was hard for me to feel out of control when our client was not responding to us. As web developer, I did not get much direct interaction with the client, so I had to utilize Brandon as a liaison. This was difficult for me because I had to communicate my vision to Brandon and trust that he would accurately convey that information to the client. Learning to do this allowed me to build trust in the team instead of trying to take everything into my own hands.

Overall, I learned a lot in this project, specifically staying on schedule and trusting my team. I am sad to be done with this project and class because it has been such a constant this semester. I will take these lessons with me for the rest of college and even into the workforce.

**YULIANNA:** Although I have done many group projects in college, this has been my first project where I was able to gain experience working on a project that has a real world impact. After learning about the semester-long project required for this class, I was excited to put my skill to use with other hardworking students on my team. From the initial idea of creating a wireframe for a local Athens business that a fellow teammate worked at, to the final completion of an amazing interactive wireframe, felt rewarding especially after all our hard work. 

Learning to work efficiently with others in a real world setting is something I learned a lot from. Especially with how we had another stakeholder in the project, the sponsor, made it different from other group projects where only work is done between the students. First, learning how to listen and understand exactly what the sponsor’s needs were and being able to communicate about realistic expectations was important. The guidelines of this project were open, so it was up to us as a team to decide how to approach the task. Being able to set a schedule of when to meet and when to have deliverables done on time, as well as making sure to always be on the same page and helping each other were things we did well as a team. 

Being able to collaborate with my team members and everyone using their different skills and strengths really helped to become as efficient as possible. Trusting others to do their best and communicating effectively are how we were able to work together seamlessly. Even with the issues we faced, such as the project being hard to reach and unresponsive, we relied on each other to work through the issues and resolve them. There will always be issues no matter what line of work anyone does, but being able to mitigate anything that came our way was definitely a lesson I learned and improved on. As someone that plans absolutely everything, this helped me work on being able to think quickly and navigate through unexpected changes. 

Learning all these skills will not only help me in my internship this summer of learning about risk mitigation and teamwork, but in my future career as well. Especially with the hopes of going into consulting, this project equipped me with lasting lessons for the future. I am proud of the growth I've made and the ability to be able to have an impact on a real-world project with an amazing team. 

**KENNEDY:** While group projects aren’t new to me or my college experience, I can genuinely say that working with this group of people has been one of the best experiences I’ve had academically. I was able to meet incredible individuals and form connections that I’ll definitely carry into the future. Any time there was a minor conflict within our group, whether that was scheduling issues or a difference in opinion, we were able to quickly resolve it. Everyone had the chance to speak their mind and communicate freely and respectfully. This created a supportive and collaborative environment that made the entire process enjoyable.

Beyond the group dynamics, the project itself was also incredibly rewarding. I felt like I could actually apply the material we learned in class to something tangible and real. It helped me see the value of the course content in a new light and inspired me to potentially pursue a form of project management in the future. Having the opportunity to take something theoretical and apply it in a way that could benefit an actual business made the work feel more meaningful and impactful.

One of the biggest takeaways from this experience was learning how to communicate and work with real-world stakeholders. As we mentioned in our binder and presentation, we originally worked with the owner of Tiger Sushi, but partway through the project he traveled to Korea, so we had to pivot and work with the manager instead. Learning to adjust, communicate consistently, and align our creative ideas with the business’s actual needs was such an important lesson. It gave me a glimpse into the type of collaboration I’ll face in the corporate world.

Academically, I found the risk matrix component of the project to be the most engaging. I enjoyed assessing, learning, and analyzing risk based on what we were taught. This stood out to me especially because I’ll be interning this summer at Wells Fargo as a Corporate Risk intern, and the insights from this project have already given me a head start. I now feel more confident in my ability to identify and mitigate risks efficiently and effectively, and I know I’ll carry this experience with me into the workplace.

**BRANDON:** Working on this group project with my fellow group members has been one of the most fulfilling academic experiences I have had throughout my college career thus far. Being that this was my first semester-long project, I learned a lot about working in a group, communication, and how to deal with problems with a client. Throughout this entire project, I have learned a multitude of valuable skills as well as friendships. Seeing how far we have come from the start to now is crazy, to say the least.

While working on this project, I feel that working with a real client and working on a project for a prolonged period was valuable not only for personal experience but also for professional experience. When I found out about this project at the start of the semester, I was very excited, as one of my biggest goals was to learn what it would be like to work on a project for longer than 2 weeks and learn from a semester-long project. Once this project was explained to us, I was very excited as I had the perfect idea for what to do, a website for Tiger Sushi where I worked. This excitement, though, turned into frustration as my owner and manager were not very cooperative. I feel that this was a great learning experience for me and my group. I feel that we as a group worked very well, even with this massive obstacle that stood in front of us. Figuring out how to proceed with this project through this challenge made me much more prepared for the professional world, as I am sure that this is a common challenge that people working on projects face every day.

For me personally, the thing I have learned most from this project has been working on communication and time management. With our sponsors not being very helpful to us, I served as a middleman as I would talk to my manager as much as possible while at work, as well as conveying what Tiger Sushi would want from a website with my personal experience working there and talking to my co-workers. As I was the middle man, I spent a lot of time communicating with my group as well as our sponsor, and being able to manage all of this while also maintaining good grades in my other classes, as well as maintaining a good social life was very difficult at first. But as the project progressed, this became much easier and has been valuable to not only my academic life but also my personal life.

Being able to work on this project has opened my eyes to the real world and what I may be doing in the future. Getting this first-hand experience has been a terrific experience for me and is something I will remember for the rest of my life. Not only was I able to gain hands-on experience, but I was also able to make friends that I will stay connected with throughout my career. I am beyond proud of what we as a group have accomplished and grateful for this experience, and am excited to implement them in my upcoming internship and future career.

   **IN SCOPE**

1. **Client Research & Interviews**  
    – Understanding Tiger Sushi’s business, audience, and branding needs.  
    – Conducting interviews to gather requirements.

2. **Wireframe Design**  
    – Designing all pages: Home, Menu, FAQ, Contact, Specials, and Photo Gallery.  
    – Ensuring brand consistency in layout and visuals.  
    – Building a user-friendly navigation structure.

3. **Image Curation & Enhancement**  
    – Using Adobe Lightroom to enhance any existing visuals provided by the client.  
    – Selecting images that reflect the brand's aesthetic.

4. **Risk Management Planning**  
    – Identifying risks like scope creep, misalignment, or lack of materials, and suggesting mitigation strategies.

5. **Project Documentation & Handoff**  
    – Delivering finalized wireframes in an organized Google Drive folder.  
    – Writing a summary document explaining key design decisions.  
    – Recommending next steps (e.g., hiring a developer).

    – Your wireframes are static. Future menu or hours updates are the client's responsibility.

3. **Professional Photography/Videography**

4. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**  
    – No keyword research or Google search ranking strategy.

5. **E-Commerce or Online Ordering Setup**  
    – We won’t be integrating platforms like ToastTab, DoorDash, etc.

6. **Social Media Strategy or Posting**  
    – Managing Instagram or linking social content is out of scope.

7. **Legal/Accessibility Compliance**  
    – No auditing for ADA or other compliance regulations.

8. **Analytics Tracking Integration**  
    – No setup for Google Analytics, heat maps, or user behavior tools.

Here’s a short and basic list of what makes a good user experience on a website:

* **Easy Navigation** – Users should find what they need quickly.

* **Clear Layout** – Content should be organized and uncluttered.

* **Fast Load Time** – Pages should load quickly on all devices.

* **Mobile-Friendly** – The site should work well on phones and tablets.

* **Readable Text** – Fonts should be easy to read with good contrast.

* **Accessible Design** – Use colors, buttons, and labels that work for everyone.

* **Interactive Features** – Forms, buttons, and menus should be easy to use.

* **Consistent Style** – Colors, fonts, and design elements should match throughout.
